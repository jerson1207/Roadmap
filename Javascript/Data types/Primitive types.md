# Primitive Types
In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:

1. string - in any computer programming language, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
2. number - is a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754). In other programming languages different numeric types exist; for example, Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums.
3. bigint - is a numeric data type that can represent integers in the arbitrary precision format. In other programming languages different numeric types can exist, for examples: Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums.
4. boolean - is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false.
5. undefined - is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.
6. Symbol -  is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive — also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol — that's guaranteed to be unique.
7. null - , a null value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid object or address. The meaning of a null reference varies among language implementations.
